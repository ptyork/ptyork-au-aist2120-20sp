File Nameing and Access

file_name.extension    "generic name"
"file name with space.ext"   if the name has a space
lettters, numbers and underscores (and dots) are recommended file name characters
hello.world.i.am.alive.txt    okay but wierd
hello.doc.tmp
folders are the same but USUALLY don't have an extension

File Organization

Windows (case INsensitive)

z:\
    Texts\
        bob.txt
        jerome.txt
    Docs\
        Kids\
            Bobby.txt
            Boopy.txt
        cindy.txt
        cathy.txt

If in the Z:\ (root) folder:
    bob.txt     ===>    type Texts\bob.txt
    Boopy.txt   ===>    type Docs\Kids\Boopy.txt

If in Z:\Texts folder:
    jerome.txt  ===>    type jerome.txt
    jerome.txt  ===>    type .\jerome.txt  (alternative)
    Bobby.txt   ===>    type z:\Docs\Kids\Bobby.txt  (absolute path)
    Bobby.txt   ===>    type \Docs\Kids\Bobby.txt  (absolute path on current drive)
    Bobby.txt   ===>    type ..\Docs\Kids\Bobby.txt  (relative path --> start navigation with parent)

If in Z:\Docs\Kids folder:
    cindy.txt   ==>     type z:\Docs\cindy.txt  (absolute)
    cindy.txt   ==>     type \Docs\cindy.txt  (absolute relative to current drive)
    cindy.txt   ==>     type ..\cindy.txt  (relative)
    

Linux / Mac / *nix (case SENSITIVE)

/ (no drive but still the "root" of the file system)
    Texts/
        bob.txt
        jerome.txt
    Docs/
        Kids/
            Bobby.txt
            Boopy.txt
        cindy.txt
        cathy.txt

If in the / (root) folder:
    bob.txt     ===>    cat Texts/bob.txt
    Boopy.txt   ===>    cat Docs\Kids\Boopy.txt

If in /Texts folder:
    jerome.txt  ===>    cat jerome.txt
    jerome.txt  ===>    cat ./jerome.txt  (alternative)
    Bobby.txt   ===>    cat /Docs/Kids/Bobby.txt  (absolute path)
    Bobby.txt   ===>    cat ../Docs/Kids/Bobby.txt  (relative path --> start navigation with parent)

If in /Docs/Kids folder:
    cindy.txt   ==>     cat /Docs/cindy.txt  (absolute)
    cindy.txt   ==>     cat ../cindy.txt  (relative)
    

.  ==> Current Directory
.. ==> Parent Directory
    
    
Current (Present) Working Directory ==> the location from which a command is executed
CWD \ PWD

Command Switches \ Options (Common Convention)
----------------------------------------------
command /something /somethingelse    is how you typically do it in Windows
command -something -somethingelse    is how you typically do it in Linux / Mac


Standard I/O
============
Terminal Input and Output
- Stream Based (NOT random access)
- Default to Keyboard Input and Terminal Output
- CAN BE REDIRECTED

PIPING
======
Output from one Command as Input for Another Command
e.g. "dir | more" can page a long directory

OUTPUT REDIRECTION
==================
COMMAND > FILENAME      Takes output and saves (overwrites) file
COMMAND >> FILENAME     Takes output and appends to file
