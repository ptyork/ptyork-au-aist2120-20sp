Filenames
=========
name.extension
name rules:
  - Windows is NOT case sensitive but Linux and Mac ARE case sensitive
  - Space ARE kinda-sorta allowed, but are a pain in the arse from the command prompt
     = so avoid them
  - Valid characters include [A-Za-z0-9] \w as well as - and _ and . and ( and ) sometimes
  - Can't end in a .
extension:
  - The charactes after the LAST .
  - Indicates the TYPE of file
  - Usually how the OS determines the associate application(s)

Windows USUALLY it is COMMAND /switch1 /switch2
Linux USUALLY it is   COMMAND --switch1 --switch2 -s



File Addressing
===============

WINDOWS

z:
    \    (root directory)
        \docs
            puppy.txt
            kitty.txt
        \hobbies
            \woodwork
                plans.txt
                todo.txt
            favorites.txt
        mystuff.txt
        budget.txt

PWD: c:\windows
    budget.txt ==> type z:\budget.txt    (ABSOLUTE path)

PWD: z:\
    budget.txt ==> type z:\budget.txt    (ABSOLUTE path)
                   type \budget.txt      (Absolute path relative to current drive)
                   type budget.txt       (RELATIVE path)
                   type .\budget.txt     (RELATIVE path funkified version)
    puppy.txt ==>   type \docs\puppy.txt (ABS)
                    type docs\puppy.txt  (REL)
    todo.txt ==>    type hobbies\woodwork\todo.txt

PWD: z:\docs
    kitty.txt ==>   type kitty.txt
    mystuff.txt ==> type \mystuff.txt (ABS)
                    type ..\mystuff.txt (REL)
    todo.txt ==>    type ..\hobbies\woodwork\todo.txt

PWD: z:\hobbies\woodwork
    favorites.txt ==> type ..\favorites.txt (REL)
                      type \hobbies\favorites.txt
    puppy.txt ==>     type ..\..\docs\puppy.txt


Linux / Mac (BASICALLY the same but swap the \ to / and there are no lettered drives)

    /    (root directory)
        /docs
            puppy.txt
            kitty.txt
        /hobbies
            /woodwork
                plans.txt
                todo.txt
            favorites.txt
        mystuff.txt
        budget.txt

PWD: /
    budget.txt ==> cat /budget.txt      (Absolute path relative to current drive)
                   cat budget.txt       (RELATIVE path)
                   cat ./budget.txt     (RELATIVE path funkified version)
    puppy.txt ==>   cat /docs/puppy.txt (ABS)
                    cat docs/puppy.txt  (REL)
    todo.txt ==>    cat hobbies/woodwork\todo.txt

PWD: /docs
    kitty.txt ==>   cat kitty.txt
    mystuff.txt ==> cat /mystuff.txt (ABS)
                    cat ../mystuff.txt (REL)
    todo.txt ==>    cat ../hobbies/woodwork/todo.txt

PWD: /hobbies/woodwork
    favorites.txt ==> cat ../favorites.txt (REL)
                      cat /hobbies/favorites.txt
    puppy.txt ==>     cat ../../docs/puppy.txt


Output Redirection
==================
Standard I/O -- Input and Output from console applications
  - default: input is KEYBOARD
  - default: output is SCREEN

COMMAND > FILENAME     ==> Outputs command ouput to a specified file (OVERWRITES THE CONTENTS)
COMMAND >> FILENAME    ==> Outputs command ouput to a specified file (APPENDS to the current file)
