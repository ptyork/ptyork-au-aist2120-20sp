    "* Interpreted (scripts) vs. Compiled\n",
    "    - Compiled programs *generally*:\n",
    "        - Are better optimized for specific platforms\n",
    "        - Are more efficient with memory allocation\n",
    "        - Are \"safer\" because they catch more errors (especially syntax errors, but also many common logic errors) during compilation\n",
    "    - Interpreted programs *generally*:\n",
    "        - Are cross-platform by nature since most run unaltered on numerous operating systems and hardware platforms\n",
    "        - Enable fast \"round-trip\" (program, test, fix) programming by eliminating the compiler step\n",
    "        - Require less \"getting started\" time and little to no development environment setup...just write code and run it.\n",
    "    - Python, Javascript, Ruby, PowerShell, Batch files, Shell scripts, etc. are USUALLY interpreted (\"scripting languages\")\n",
    "    - C, C++, Java, C#, etc. are USUALLY compiled into a binary executable before running\n",
    "* REPL (read-evaluate-print loop)\n",
    "    - All interpreted languages also have an accompanying REPL (or \"interactive shell\")\n",
